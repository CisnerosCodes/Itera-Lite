## 📦 Dependencies Status

### ❌ Currently Missing (Critical)
These will be installed by running `setup_env.ps1`:

1. **PyTorch** (Core framework)
   - Required for all model development
   - Will be installed with CUDA 12.1 support

2. **Transformers** (Baseline models)
3. **Mamba-SSM** (State Space Models)
4. **Accelerate** (Training utilities)
5. **NumPy, TQDM, Datasets** (Essential tools)

### ⚠️ Optional Dependencies
Will attempt installation (may require specific hardware):

- **BitsAndBytes** (Quantization)
- **Flash-Attention** (Optimized attention)
- **PEFT** (LoRA and efficient fine-tuning)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Immediate Action Required

Run the environment setup script:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory (if not already there)
cd c:\Users\adria\Itera-Lite

# Run the setup script
.\setup_env.ps1
```

**Expected Duration:** 5-15 minutes (depending on internet speed)

### What the Script Will Do

1. ✅ Verify Python 3.10+ is installed
2. ✅ Activate your virtual environment
3. 📦 Install PyTorch with CUDA support
4. 📦 Install all core dependencies
5. 📦 Attempt optional dependency installation
6. 🔍 Verify installation and show GPU info
7. 📊 Display final status report

## 🔍 Post-Installation Verification Checklist

After running `setup_env.ps1`, verify:

- [ ] PyTorch installed with correct version
- [ ] CUDA detected (if GPU available)
- [ ] GPU VRAM capacity identified
- [ ] All core packages installed successfully
- [ ] Optional packages status noted
- [ ] Updated `hardware_report.txt` reviewed

## 📞 Troubleshooting Tips

### If PyTorch Installation Fails
- Check internet connection
- Ensure sufficient disk space (>5GB free)
- Try CPU-only version: `pip install torch`

### If Mamba-SSM Fails
- This requires CUDA toolkit
- Can fall back to alternative SSM implementations
- Not critical for initial prototyping

### If Flash-Attention Fails
- This is optional and requires specific CUDA setup
- Project can proceed without it
- Mainly affects baseline Transformer speed
